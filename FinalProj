#This is my Final SQL project from Break Into Tech 

#The database consists of data storing the following employees, customers, invoices, invoice items, artists, albums, media type, genre, tracks, and playlists.

#1 Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT FirstName, LastName,Customerid FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> "United States";

#2 Show only the Customers from Brazil. 

SELECT * FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country = "Brazil" ;

#3 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.Invoiceid, i.InvoiceDate, c.Country
FROM chinook.customers c
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.Customerid=i.Customerid
WHERE c.Country="Brazil";

#4 Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT LastName, FirstName, Title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";

#5 Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry 
FROM chinook.Invoices ;

#6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT e.LastName, e.FirstName, i.Invoiceid
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c ON c.SupportRepID = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices i ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId;

#7 Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT c.LastName, c.FirstName, e.LastName, e.FirstName, c.Country, i.total
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices i ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId;

#8 How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(invoiceid) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE "%2009%";

#9 What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(total) FROM chinook.invoices 
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE "%2009%";

#10 Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

WHERE e.Title = "Sales Support Agent"
Group By e.FirstName;

#14 Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT e.LastName, e.FirstName, ROUND(SUM(i.Total),2) AS 'Total'
